			    <h2>Kitchen remodeling was a large stress for me</h2>
			    <p> I actually stumbled on a kitchen cabinet design program by accident. I would never have guessed that there was a program on line to model kitchen cabinet designs. </p>
				  <p>I mean discuss a niche market! Nonetheless, there it was. It only cost me a few bucks a month, and it was a pretty useful tool. It was a little bit hard to learn at first, but once I got the hang of it, it wasn't bad. 
				  </p>
			    <p>Basically,It was a simplified architectural design program - made for individuals like me who don't know much about computers. They must have had some deals with a kitchen cabinet designer somewhere. </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aC2p92qbbo0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
			    <p>The program could model almost all the popular kitchen cabinet designs on <a href="https://www.customcabinetsnc.com/">www.customcabinetsnc.com</a> It even had mock ups of refrigerators, kitchen islands, and basic shapes of kitchen tables. </p>
			    <p>It wasn't complete, but it was definitely good enough to give me an idea of what my kitchen would look like with various design elements.	    
				    I finally picked out a perfect kitchen cabinet design. </p>
				  <p>I decide to go with a dark oak. I picked out some pretty low profile kitchen cabinets. At first, I had been tempted to get big types with a lot of storage room, but then I thought better of it. </p>
				  <p>I wanted everything to have a very sleek, angular, minimal look to it. My kitchen was big enough that I would have enough storage space regardless, and I'm tall enough to get to the upper cabinets without much of a problem. </p>
				  <p>That allowed me to use smaller kitchen cabinet designs, which in turn made the kitchen feel even less cluttered. All in all, it was a great effect. As a matter of fact, when I was done it looked precisely like the program! </p>
